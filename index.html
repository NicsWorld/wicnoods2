        <h1>Dinner.dev</h1>
        <p>Dinner.dev is a project that was born from my wife and I asking each other, "What's for dinner?" And never being able to come to a conclusion. This app uses your location to randomly select a restaraunt near you.</p>
        <p>I'm still looking forward to adding more features and improving this project in the future, such as a voting systems, and a different variety of filters.</p>
        <p>Check it out here! <a href="https://dinner.dev">https://dinner.dev</a></p>

        <h1>Urls.day</h1>
        <p>urls.day is a project that I launched strictly to learn. I wanted to learn more about the Golang programming language, which I wrote the backend in, and I wanted to learn more about Google Cloud, which I deployed this application to.</p>
        <p>This application is essentially a url shortener. You can shorten, lengthen (sp?), and custom endings to a url. 
        <div>It was a lot of fun to build, and I learned a lot through this project: <a href="https://urls.day">https://urls.day</a></div></p>

        <h1>Diddle chrome extension</h1>
        <p>Diddle was a fun little experiment of mine, that was inspired by Slack. When you are in a Slack huddle, when someone is sharing their screen, you can essentially doodle on their screen and it will slowly fade away.</p>
        <p>I was inspired enough to see if I could find a way to accomplish this on the web. It was a lot of fun, and I am proud I was able to figure out *something* that works. </p>
        <p>It's not currently in the Chrome Extension store, but you can install it locally and play with it if you wish: <a href="https://github.com/NicsWorld/diddle">https://github.com/NicsWorld/diddle</a></p>
